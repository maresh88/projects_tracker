# Project_Tracker

This is a pet-project that is designed to help with tracking small tasks/projects. Despite the fact that it is "TO DO list" based project it has a number of features:
1. Multiple users can log in and start tracking own projects.
2. Implemented the manager-reporter model with django-mptt.
3. Added a feature for commenting on projects.
4. Filtering projects by some fields.
